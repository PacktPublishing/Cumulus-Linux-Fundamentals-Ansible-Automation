# Cumulus Linux Fundamentals + Ansible Automation
This is the code repository for [Cumulus Linux Fundamentals + Ansible Automation](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/practical-ansible-solutions-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788476904), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The course includes hands on demonstrations using both Cumulus VX and physical switches. The best part is you can practice using GNS3 and Cumulus VX locally on your laptop! Cumulus Linux combines the power of open networking with a network operating system that runs on top of industry-standard networking hardware from vendors such as Dell, HP, Quanta, and others. Founded by veteran networking engineers from Cisco and VMware, Cumulus Networks makes the first Linux operating system for networking hardware and fills a critical gap: realizing the true promise of the software-defined data center. Just as Linux completely transformed economics and innovation on the server side of the data center, Cumulus Linux is performing the same function for networks. It is radically reducing the costs and complexities of operating modern data center networks for service providers and businesses of all sizes. By providing a software-only solution, Cumulus Linux enables the disaggregation of data center switches akin to x86 server hardware/software disaggregation. Data-center networking is rapidly standardizing on merchant silicon; with Cumulus Linux, networking is currently adopting the Linux and disaggregation principles the compute world.
